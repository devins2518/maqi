# Maqi

A tui email client built with simplicity in mind. Aerc, mutt, and neomutt are all great email
clients, but they're far too complicated for end users without PhDs in E-Mail RFCs. With maqi, the user
can simply add their email credentials with a pre-set server configuration (iCloud, GMail, Outlook,
etc) similar to how one would add an email account to their iPhone.

## IMAP Implementation

Maqi uses its own (heavily unfinished) IMAP client implementation based on IMAP V4rev2 (RFC 9051).
